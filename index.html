I lead the Secure Scientific Service Mesh (S3M) project at ORNL, lead the <a href="https://science.osti.gov/grants/Lab-Announcements/-/media/grants/pdf/lab-announcements/2025/LAB-25-3555.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Science Cloud</a> Interfaces Team within ORNL, and serve as ORNL’s representative to the DOE Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI) Technical Interfaces Subcommittee. My work explores how data science and distributed computing can come together to help scientists tackle complex problems, automate their research, and push for field-redefining breakthroughs on our nation's largest supercomputers. Some questions I've explored recently are:

                <li>How can we rethink human interaction with supercomputers—moving beyond the command line toward automated, secure, and intelligent interfaces?</li>
                <li>What trade-offs emerge when orchestrating agentic workflows that span supercomputers, microscopes, and analysis clusters?</li>
                <li>How might we make scientific repositories self-organizing and searchable without labor-intensive curation?</li>
                <li>And what artificial-intelligence techniques can transform raw data into richly indexed, discoverable knowledge?</li>
