        <br>

        <p class="intro-text">I am a research scientist in the <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/group/workflows-and-ecosystem-services">Workflow and Ecosystem Services (WES) group</a> at the National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS)
        at Oak Ridge National Lab. Additionally, I am an Adjunct Professor in the Computing and Data Analytics Department at
        Trinity Christian College in Palos Heights, IL. I am also the original founder of the NightWare (previously myBivy) application for monitoring and
            treating nightmares in patients with PTSD.
        </p>

        <p class="intro-text">
            My work crosses the thresholds of data science and distributed computing, with a primary focus on designing
            distributed workflow orchestration systems capable of handling expansive compute requirements and data volumes. I build these systems
            so that the lab can perform autonomous experimentation.
            My data science expertise spans statistical and deep learning approaches for search-driven data mining and time series analytics.

        </p>
    <p class="intro-text">
            I stay actively involved in the computing community. I am currently serving as the publicity
            chair for eScience '24, and have previously served on program committees for SC, HPDC, IPDPS, ICPP, and SciPy.
            I served on the curriculum development team for the Data4All bridge workshop for South-Chicago high school
            students.
